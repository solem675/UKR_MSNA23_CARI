The CARI utilizes several indicators to measure the overall food security status of households.
There are two main dimensions in Food security status: Current Status of consumption, which 
describes the adequacy of current food consumption of the household) and Coping Capacity, 
which measures householdâ€™s resilience to shocks. Current status is represented by the FCS and 
rCSI. Coping capacity is measured by the ECMEN and Livelihood Coping.
